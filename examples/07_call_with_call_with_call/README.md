# 07_call_with_call_with_call

This example demonstrates closures and nested function calls.

## Usage

```bash
go run main.go script.ice
```

## Description
The script creates a closure `makeAdder` and uses it to create two adder functions. It then chains these function calls together, verifying that the closure environment is correctly captured and maintained.
